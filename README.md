# ColdStart Challenge

Welcome to the üßä **ColdStart coding challenge** üßä! In this series you will use your cloud development skills to help our penguin siblings start up their ice cream parlor and delivery service üç®.

The goal of this initiative is to let you explore and get hands-on experience with some of the [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.com) cloud services, through a series of **fun coding challenges**. 
Each challenge will build on the previous one and will focus on a specific technology topic. You can expect to learn about hosting web applications, building chatbots, different data services, AI, containers, serverless, and IoT.

We will release a new coding challenge **every fortnight**, which you can then work on by yourself or you can team up with your peers. After two weeks we'll then share the solution to the challenge. So, if you skipped one excercise you can jump back in with the next. 

There are **6 coding challenges** in total and of course we hope you'll join for all of them! If you're one of the first 40 participants to **complete 3 of the first 5** coding challenges, you'll **receive an IoT device** that will help you complete the last, IoT-based challenge!

## <a name="backstory"></a>What's the back story of ColdStart?

This is the story of two penguins who are taking their first steps as startup founders. They are planning to begin an ice cream parlor and home delivery service, called **ColdStart** üç®.

Six months ago, the penguin siblings' grandmother retired. She left them the ice cream recipe that has been in the family for many generations. Now both penguins decided to start an ice cream business üçß! However, they have no clue of how to build and host a website, process customer orders and track and trace the home deliveries. They're calling on you for help!

You will use the Microsoft Azure cloud services to build all of the IT infrastructure needed for running their entire business.
