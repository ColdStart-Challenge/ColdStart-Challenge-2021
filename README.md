The goal of this initiative is to let you explore and get hands-on experience with some of the [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.com) cloud services through a series of **fun coding challenges**. 
Each challenge will build on the previous one and will focus on a specific technology topic. You can expect to learn about hosting web applications, building chatbots, different data service, AI, containers, serverless, and IoT.
